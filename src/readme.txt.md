## How restaurant works?
First of all, Restaurant can't make orders when it's closed. Restaurants have to open the Restaurant first. Orders are filtered to Online and Stationary Orders. Online Orders are made first and are sent only when a Supplier is in the Restaurant. Stationary Orders are being made by Cooker and Delivered by Waiter. Because Kitchen is not so big it's not affordable to employ too many Cookers.
Waiters can get Tips, which depend on the time of deliverance and Cost of Order.
Some Dishes cannot be made due to the lack of Products in the Kitchen. When our Client orders a Dish that cannot be made, he is informed of this by Exception.
